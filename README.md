## Alex's Password Generator

![Image of the fucntional app](Assets/screeny.png?raw=true "Alex's Password Generator")

In this repository a functional random password generator can be found.
The way it generates its random values is through the Math.random() function picking a random number and 
assigning that number to a character through the use of the .fromCharCode() function which assigns certain
numbers to certain characters (for instance: 97 = a, 98 = b, 99 = c, 55 = 7, 56=8, etc).


The only conditions to make the password generate is to have at least one condition box ticked with a length set 
and then you may hit the "Generate" button to create a password that fits the users
